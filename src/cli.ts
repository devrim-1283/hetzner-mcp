/**
 * The `hetzner-mcp` CLI: install, doctor, uninstall, connections, serve.
 *
 * A separate binary from `src/index.ts`, which is the stdio MCP server. That
 * one may write nothing but JSON-RPC to stdout; this one is an ordinary
 * terminal program, so here stdout carries the command's product (report, diff,
 * JSON) and stderr carries prompts and diagnostics. Keeping the two apart is
 * what lets `hetzner-mcp doctor --json | jq` work while a confirmation prompt is
 * still visible to the human.
 *
 * `serve` runs the MCP server out of this binary too, and does not weaken that
 * rule. Its protocol channel is a socket, so stdout belongs to nobody and a
 * startup banner on it is safe; everything the running server itself emits still
 * goes to stderr, exactly as in stdio mode.
 *
 * Argument parsing is `node:util` `parseArgs` and nothing else. A CLI framework
 * would be a runtime dependency on the critical path of `npx hetzner-mcp`, where
 * cold start is a user-visible property, in exchange for flags we can declare in
 * twenty lines.
 *
 * No shebang here — tsup prepends one, and a second `#!` on line 2 of the bundle
 * is a syntax error rather than a comment.

const USAGE = `${PROGRAM} — fleet-level MCP server for Hetzner

USAGE
  ${PROGRAM} <command> [options]

COMMANDS
  install       write a hetzner entry into one or more MCP client configs
  doctor        read-only health check: connections, client configs, credentials at rest
  uninstall     remove the entries this CLI wrote
  connections   list resolved connections, their surfaces, and where each credential comes from
  serve         run the MCP server over HTTP (--http); stdio is hetzner-mcp-server

  ${PROGRAM} <command> --help    per-command options
  ${PROGRAM} --version`;

const INSTALL_HELP = `${PROGRAM} install — write a hetzner entry into MCP client configs

  The installer writes POINTERS only: a command, its arguments, and at most a
  connection NAME. It never writes a credential into a client config, so the
  worst outcome of a bug here is a broken MCP entry rather than a leaked token.

OPTIONS
  --client a,b           target these clients (repeatable). Default: every detected client.
  --all-detected         target every detected client; the explicit form of the default.
  --scope user|project   user config or repo-local config. Default: both, filtered by detection.
  --connection NAME      bake HETZNER_CONNECTION=NAME into the entry.
  --pin[=VERSION]        pin an exact version. See VERSION PINNING.
  --transport stdio|http default stdio. Never written to Codex — see TRANSPORT.
  --no-native-cli        always write files; never shell out to a client's own CLI.
  --update               overwrite an existing hetzner entry instead of leaving it alone.
  --dry-run              print a unified diff of every file that would change; write nothing.
  --print                print the snippet to paste by hand; write nothing.
  --yes                  do not ask for confirmation.
  --json                 machine-readable result on stdout.

VERSION PINNING
  Without --pin the entry reads <package>@latest, so every client spawn
  resolves the newest published version and may execute code that did not exist
  when you installed it. Convenient for one developer; unacceptable under most
  software supply-chain policies.

    --pin           pin the version you are running now
    --pin=1.4.2     pin an exact version

  A pinned install upgrades only when you run install again.

TRANSPORT
  stdio is the default and the only transport ever written to Codex. Older Codex
  versions drop the WHOLE config.toml — every other MCP server in it included —
  when they meet an unknown \`url\` key, and stdio parses in every version.`;

const DOCTOR_HELP = `${PROGRAM} doctor — read-only health check

  Reports the runtime, every connection with its surface and credential source,
  every client adapter, and then the findings. Nothing is written unless --fix
  is passed.

OPTIONS
  --all-servers   also attribute MCP entries hetzner-mcp does not manage.
  --fix           conservative repair; see below.
  --json          machine-readable report on stdout.

EXIT CODES
  0  clean
  1  warnings
  2  a credential was found at rest
  Suitable for a fleet-wide CI job: \`${PROGRAM} doctor --json\`.

--fix IS CONSERVATIVE BY DESIGN
  It rewrites a literal secret to \${VAR} only when $VAR is already exported with
  exactly that value and the client is known to expand the reference. It never
  invents a variable, never prints a secret to stdout, and never substitutes for
  rotating a token: a credential that has sat in plaintext should be considered
  burned no matter what happens to the file afterwards.`;

const UNINSTALL_HELP = `${PROGRAM} uninstall — remove the entries this CLI wrote

OPTIONS
  --client a,b   remove from these clients (repeatable).
  --all          consider every known client, not just the ones detected here.
  --scope user|project
  --force        remove even when the entry no longer matches what we wrote.
  --dry-run      print the diff; write nothing.
  --yes          do not ask for confirmation.
  --json         machine-readable result on stdout.

  Without --force an entry that has been hand-edited since installation is left
  alone and reported. Deleting someone's customised entry is not an uninstall.`;

const CONNECTIONS_HELP = `${PROGRAM} connections — list resolved connections

  Prints each connection, the Hetzner API surface it reaches, where its
  credential comes from, and whether that source actually resolves. Resolving
  may prompt (Touch ID, a vault unlock); that is the point — "the variable is
  set" and "the credential comes back" are different questions.

  No credential, and no part of one, is ever printed.

OPTIONS
  --json   machine-readable output on stdout.`;

const SERVE_HELP = `${PROGRAM} serve — run the MCP server over HTTP

  The same server, the same tools, the same gates as stdio — reached over a
  socket instead of a pipe, so it can run somewhere other than the machine the
  client is on.

  --http is required rather than implied by "serve". A second transport is a
  plausible future, and a bare "serve" that silently means one of them is a
  rename waiting to break every config that had already written it down.

  This command does not return. It stays in the foreground until Ctrl-C or
  SIGTERM, then closes the listener and exits 0.

OPTIONS
  --http               required; see above.
  --port N             default ${DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT}. 0 binds an ephemeral port, reported at startup.
  --host ADDR          default ${DEFAULT_HTTP_HOST}. See BINDING.
  --allowed-host HOST  also accept this Host/Origin (repeatable). ${ALLOWED_HOSTS_ENV}
                       carries the same list, comma-separated, so a container
                       does not have to restate the whole command to add one.

AUTHENTICATION
  ${AUTH_TOKEN_ENV} is required and serve refuses to start without it. A
  process that binds a port while holding live Hetzner credentials and answers
  whoever asks is not a degraded configuration, it is an incident.

  It is NOT a Hetzner token. Clients present this one; the server holds the
  Hetzner credentials and never hands them out, so a compromised client
  credential does not become a Hetzner credential, and rotating either leaves
  the other alone.

BINDING
  The default is ${DEFAULT_HTTP_HOST}, so an absent-minded serve is not a service on
  the LAN. --host 0.0.0.0 has to be typed — inside a container it should be,
  because there the container is the network boundary.

  DNS rebinding protection is always on: Host and Origin are checked against the
  address actually bound. Behind a reverse proxy the public hostname is not that
  address, so name it with --allowed-host or every proxied request is refused.

ENDPOINTS
  POST ${MCP_PATH} — MCP JSON-RPC, bearer required. GET and DELETE answer 405: the
    session model is stateless, so there is no stream to open and no session to
    end.
  GET ${HEALTH_PATH} — liveness, unauthenticated on purpose. It is what a container
    health check and a load balancer call, and neither of them carries a token.
    It reveals only that a process is listening: no connection names, no
    version, no configuration.

  Request logs go to stderr, one line each, never the Authorization header and
  never a body. TLS is the reverse proxy's job; this speaks plain HTTP behind
  it.`;
