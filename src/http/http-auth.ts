/**
 * The HTTP transport's front door.
 *
 * `serve --http` binds a port on a process that is holding live Hetzner
 * credentials. Everything in this file follows from that one sentence: the
 * endpoint is reachable by anything that can route to it, and behind it sits a
 * credential that can create, reboot and delete infrastructure — and, on the
 * Robot surface, cancel a physical machine.
 *
 * Two rules, and they are the whole file:
 *
 *  1. The server REFUSES TO START without $HETZNER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN, and refuses a
 *     short one the same way. Same fail-closed posture as the existing "no
 *     connections configured" refusal, for a stronger reason: a server that
 *     binds a port while holding a Hetzner token and accepts anyone is not a
 *     degraded configuration, it is an incident.
 *
 *  2. The comparison is constant-time AND length-blind. See {@link fingerprint};
 *     the second half of that pair is the part that is usually got wrong.
 *
 * The secret a client presents is deliberately NOT a Hetzner token. The server
 * holds those and never sends them anywhere; the client presents this unrelated
 * one. So a compromised MCP client credential does not become a Hetzner
 * credential, and rotating either does not force rotating the other.

 * compare equal-width inputs. The obvious repair is
 *
 *     if (a.length !== b.length) return false;   // WRONG
 *
 * and it re-introduces precisely the leak `timingSafeEqual` was chosen to avoid.
 * That branch answers in nanoseconds for a wrong length and in microseconds for
 * a right one, so an attacker who can time the endpoint recovers the expected
 * token's length by sending 1, 2, 3... characters and watching for the step.
 * Length is the first thing needed to brute-force a secret and precisely the
 * thing a constant-time compare is supposed to hide, so the "fix" hands back
 * more than the naive `===` would have.
 *
 * Hashing first REMOVES the problem instead of guarding it: every input becomes
 * 32 bytes, `timingSafeEqual` can never throw, and no branch anywhere in this
 * file reads a length at all. Equal digests imply equal inputs by SHA-256's
 * collision resistance — a far stronger assumption than anything else here
 * rests on.
 *
 * HMAC under a per-process random key rather than a bare digest — the "double
 * HMAC" comparison. A bare SHA-256 of a chosen input is computable by whoever
 * chose it, so any residual signal in the comparison would be a signal about
 * bytes they can predict and search. Keyed with 32 bytes they have never seen,
 * the compared values are unpredictable to them and the comparison gives up
 * nothing even if it were not constant-time. Cost: one `randomBytes(32)` at
 * startup.
 *
 * What this does NOT hide is the time to hash the PRESENTED value, which grows
 * with its length. That is the attacker's own input, whose length they already
 * know.
