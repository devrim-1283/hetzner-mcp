/**
 * The Streamable HTTP transport.
 *
 * A second entry point alongside `index.ts`, and deliberately nothing more than
 * that: same `buildServer`, same tools, same gates, reached over a socket
 * instead of a pipe. `server.ts` was written transport-agnostic so this file
 * could exist without touching it, and nothing here is allowed to change what
 * the server IS — only how a caller reaches it.
 *
 * What this file owns is everything that only matters once the caller is on a
 * network rather than on the other end of a pipe the OS handed us:
 *
 *   1. AUTH BEFORE BYTES. The bearer check reads one header and answers, before
 *      the body is touched. A 401 that first buffers megabytes is a denial of
 *      service wearing an access control's clothes.
 *   2. A CAP ON EVERY BODY, enforced while reading rather than after. See
 *      `readBody`.
 *   3. A FRESH SERVER PER POST. See `dispatch`.
 *
 * Diagnostics go to stderr, as in stdio mode — and not merely by habit. The
 * `no-console` rule and the `process.stdout` ban in `eslint.config.js` cover the
 * whole of `src/` precisely because the stdio entry point cannot survive a stray
 * write, and a second rule carved out for HTTP mode would be a rule to forget.
 * Docker captures both streams anyway.
 *
 * Every line this file writes passes through `note`, which redacts, flattens and
 * caps it. That is not decoration: Host, Origin and the request target are all
 * attacker-controlled, and a newline in any of them would otherwise forge a
 * second log line that reads like the server said it.
