/**
 * Execution: run a plan's operations against the filesystem.
 *
 * Everything that decides WHAT to write lives in the adapters and the planner.
 * This module decides only WHETHER and HOW: the confidence gate, drift
 * protection, atomic writes, and the install-state bookkeeping that makes
 * uninstall safe.
 *
 * `--dry-run` is this same function with `dryRun: true`. It builds the exact
 * bytes it would have written and returns them without writing, so the diff a
 * user approves is produced by the code that then runs — not by a parallel
 * "preview" implementation that can drift from it.
 *
 * Two refusals are mechanical here, and mechanical on purpose:
 *
 *  - An adapter with `confidence: 'unverified'` is NEVER written; it is
 *    downgraded to print-only with a banner. This is not an editorial judgement
 *    about a particular client — writing a guessed config key into a user's
 *    agent config can break every other tool in that file, and "we were fairly
 *    sure" is not a good enough reason to risk it. Promotion is a code change
 *    backed by upstream documentation or a reproducible probe.
 *  - A writer that returns a `severity: 'error'` issue blocks its whole target.
 *    Targets are all-or-nothing: a half-applied plan is worse than no plan,
 *    because the user now has to work out which half.
