/**
 * JSONC merge writer.
 *
 * NON-NEGOTIABLE: this writer edits text through `jsonc-parser`'s
 * `modify()` + `applyEdits()`. A `JSON.parse` / `JSON.stringify` round trip is
 * FORBIDDEN here and the adapter contract says so, because it silently deletes
 * every comment and trailing comma in the file.
 *
 * The concrete case is Zed: `settings.json` is JSONC, Zed's own default file
 * ships full of comments, and users annotate theirs. Destroying that on
 * `hetzner-mcp install` is a support ticket per user, and the user has no way
 * to know we did it until they next open the file.
 *
 * `modify()` returns minimal edits, so everything outside the property we touch
 * — comments, trailing commas, blank lines, the container's other servers —
 * survives untouched. The one cosmetic exception is a sibling written on a
 * single line (`"other": { "command": "x" }`), which the formatter expands when
 * it re-emits the container on insertion. That is a whitespace change to
 * machine-written text and costs no information.
