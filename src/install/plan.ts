/**
 * Planning: turn "install into these clients" into inert data.

 * The plan is built entirely from `adapter.planWrite` / `adapter.planRemove`,
 * which are pure. Nothing here decides how a file is written — it decides only
 * WHAT would be written, as a list of `Operation` values that apply() then
 * executes. `--dry-run` and a real install therefore run the same planner over
 * the same inputs and differ in exactly one place: whether apply() calls
 * `writeFile`.
 *
 * The one thing this module does touch the disk for is selection: with no
 * `--client` we have to look at the machine to decide which clients are there.
 * That is detection, not planning, and it is skippable.
