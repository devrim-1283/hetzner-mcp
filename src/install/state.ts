/**
 * Durable install state: `~/.hetzner-mcp/install-state.json`.
 *
 * The installer edits files it does not own, so it has to remember what it
 * wrote. Three behaviours depend on this file and on nothing else:
 *
 *  - **Idempotent install.** A second install of the same version is a no-op
 *    rather than a rewrite.
 *  - **Drift detection.** `entryHash` is the fingerprint of the entry as we
 *    left it. If the entry on disk hashes differently, a human edited it —
 *    install warns and skips instead of reverting their change, and uninstall
 *    refuses instead of deleting it.
 *  - **Honest uninstall.** Without a record we cannot tell our entry from one
 *    the user wrote by hand under the same name, and deleting someone else's
 *    configuration is the one unrecoverable thing this tool could do.
 *
 * Nothing secret is stored here: paths, hashes, timestamps and the package
 * spec. The file is still written 0600 — its contents map a machine's tooling,
 * which is not something to publish by accident.
