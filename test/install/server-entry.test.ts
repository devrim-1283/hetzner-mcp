/**
 * The entry the installer writes has to START THE STDIO SERVER.
 *
 * Every other test in this directory asks whether the installer wrote the file
 * correctly — idempotently, without eating a neighbouring server, byte-identical
 * to the documented snippet. None of them asked the prior question: does the
 * argv in that entry launch an MCP server at all? It did not, and the whole
 * suite stayed green, because a wrong-but-consistent command is consistent.
 *
 * The trap is a consequence of the rename documented in
 * doctor-package-spec.test.ts. This package ships TWO bins:
 *
 *   hetzner-mcp         dist/cli.js     install / doctor / check — a terminal
 *                                       program that prints usage and exits 1
 *                                       when it is given no command
 *   hetzner-mcp-server  dist/index.js   the stdio MCP server
 *
 * `npx <spec>` runs the bin whose NAME MATCHES THE PACKAGE'S UNSCOPED NAME. For
 * `@donedynamics/hetzner-mcp` that is `hetzner-mcp` — the CLI. So the obvious
 * `npx -y @donedynamics/hetzner-mcp@latest` spawns the CLI, which writes usage
 * to stderr and exits before speaking a single byte of JSON-RPC. The client
 * reports "failed to connect" and nothing in the config looks wrong.
 *
 * Reaching the other bin requires naming it: `npx -y -p <spec> hetzner-mcp-server`.
 *
 * These assertions are deliberately made against package.json rather than
 * against a hard-coded string. A future rename of either bin has to break this
 * test — that is the entire point, since the last rename slipped through by
 * changing a name nothing asserted on.
